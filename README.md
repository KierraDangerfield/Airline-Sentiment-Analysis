# Airline Sentiment Analysis

As a business changes, so do their customer interests and sentiments. Businesses can use sentiment analysis to track customer sentiment when launching a new product or changing the price of their products. Tracking sentiment analysis can help businesses improve products and services. Twitter is a great way to gather sentiment from customers because the platform was created to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent messages. Using Twitter is a great way to keep track of customer sentiment about your product, service, or business on social media. It also can help detect angry customers or negative comments. A business can use this for marketing. Using Twitter for your sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights that drive business decisions. What do customers like about your business? What do customers hate or love about your products? A business can also use this for customer support. When a model can predict if a tweet is positive or negative, a bot can respond with an appropriate message to help a customer. My goal is to gather the sentiment analysis of a variety of airlines. I will get the predictive words that will determine a positive or negative sentiment.
